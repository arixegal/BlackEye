---- About the SwipeToExit branch ----
This branch contains code for enabling Exit by a Swipe gesture instead of a Tap.
The UI for enabling this option will be availble through the iPhone settings app, by implementing an iOS Settings Bundle.

After enabling this option, a tap will not cause the appo to exit. 
This allows the user to pretend to be texting messages wile the app is taking photos.
